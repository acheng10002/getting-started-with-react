<!-- during development, Vite is a server, and index.html is the entry point to my app 
 What are components?
  individual, reusable chunks
  These are JS functions that can take an input and return a React element: 
  App - represents my main application; will be the parent of all other components 
  Navbar - nav bar
  MainArticle - component that renders my main content
  NewsletterForm - form that lets a user input their email to receive the weekly
                   newsletter 
  What does a React element look like?
  it's a plain object representation of a UI component
    plain object - object created using the object literal syntax or the Object constructor
  it's created using JSX
    const element = <h1>&quot;I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.&quot;</h1>;
      ReactDOM.render() would render the element to the DOM in a typical React app
    another ex: <img src="../public/fried-chicken.png" alt="fried chicken"></img>;
  How are components created?
    How would I create a functional component?
      like JS functions!
      function Greeting() {
        return (
          // &quot; is escape code used to render "
          <h1>&quot;I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.&quot;</h1>
        );
      }

      function MyFavFood() {
        return <img src="../public/fried-chicken.png" alt="fried chicken"></img>;
      }
  Where do components live?
    in a directory, but it ability to use functionality created elsewhere and to
    share itself with other components
    How do I export and then import a component?
      same as export/import statements for JS modules

      <!-- I will often want to display multiple similar components from a collection of data 
           - need to show several instances of the same component using different data when building UIs
             exs. lists of comments, galleries of profile images, etc. 
             - the data can be stored in obejcts and arrays, and use array methods 
     JS array methods can be used to manipulate an array of data and render lists of components
     use filter() and map() with React to filter and transform my array of data into an array
     of components
